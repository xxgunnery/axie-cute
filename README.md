## Introduction

This is an open source repository for a new app in the Axie Infinity ecosystem. It's a Tinder-like system for ranking marketed axies by their 'cuteness'!

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and then run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# and
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). This endpoint can be created in the folder `pages/api`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
